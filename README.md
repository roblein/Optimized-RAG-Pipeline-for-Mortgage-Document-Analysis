# Optimized-RAG-Pipeline-for-Mortgage-Document-Analysis
My project is a RAG pipeline that efficiently extracts information from mortgage documents. It uses section-based chunking, query reranking, and a local LLM to quickly and accurately answer natural language queries.  This system streamlines document analysis for mortgage agents, ultimately making homeownership more accessible.
