        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the construction of an Optimized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed for question answering over custom documents. The pipeline is built using a combination of open-source libraries, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`llama-cpp-python`**: For loading and running a quantized Large Language Model (LLM) efficiently, leveraging GPU acceleration.\n",
        "*   **`sentence-transformers`**: For generating high-quality text embeddings used for semantic search and retrieval.\n",
        "*   **Manual Indexing and Retrieval**: A custom implementation to create an in-memory vector index and perform similarity search, bypassing potential compatibility issues with standard LlamaIndex vector stores in this environment.\n",
        "*   **Manual Response Synthesis**: Logic to construct a prompt with retrieved context and use the loaded LLM to synthesize an answer.\n",
        "*   **`gradio`**: For creating an interactive web interface to easily query the RAG pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline processes an uploaded PDF document, splits it into manageable chunks, generates embeddings for each chunk, and stores them in an in-memory index. When a user submits a query via the Gradio interface, the pipeline finds the most relevant document chunks using embedding similarity, feeds them into the LLM along with the query, and returns the generated answer. This optimized approach ensures efficient processing and accurate responses based on the document content."

        "*   **`llama-cpp-python`**: Enables efficient execution of quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) in GGUF format, leveraging GPU acceleration.\n",
        "*   **`sentence-transformers`**: Used for generating high-quality text embeddings for semantic search and retrieval.\n",
        "*   **`pymupdf` / `pypdf`**: Libraries for processing PDF documents and extracting text content.\n",
        "*   **`gradio`**: Used to create the interactive web-based user interface for the RAG pipeline.\n",
        "*   **`accelerate`, `bitsandbytes`, `einops`**: Libraries that assist in optimizing model loading and inference performance.\n",

It includes a check to ensure these components are initialized.\n",

        "4.  **Retrieve Relevant Nodes**: It retrieves the actual `TextNode` objects corresponding to the top-k indices. These are the document chunks most relevant to the query.\n",
        "5.  **Construct Synthesis Prompt**: It combines the text content of the retrieved nodes into a single context string. It then formats a prompt for the LLM, including the retrieved context and the original user query, instructing the LLM to answer based *only* on the provided context.\n",
        "6.  **Synthesize Response**: It calls the `create_completion` method on the `llm` object (your `llama_cpp.Llama` Mistral model) with the constructed prompt. The LLM generates a response based on the provided context.\n",
